# Why Promises?

The need for this project arose from the desire to delve deeper into the mechanics of promises. By building a custom Promise implementation, I aimed to gain insights into how promises manage asynchronous tasks, handle success and failure states, and facilitate chaining of asynchronous operations.

## How to Run
```bash
npm start promise.js
```
# Conclusion

The MyPromise project provides a hands-on approach to understanding promises in JavaScript. By exploring the internal workings of promises and experimenting with custom implementations, developers can gain a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming concepts.
